# üõ°Ô∏è ThreatShield

A unified, AI-powered cybersecurity platform designed to protect Digital India. This project was built for the [Name of Hackathon].

## The Problem
India's rapid digitization has exposed citizens, startups, and government infrastructure to a new wave of sophisticated cyber threats, including UPI scams, cloud data leaks, and attacks on AI models.

## Our Solution
ThreatShield is an all-in-one dashboard that provides three critical layers of defense:
* **ThreatEye:** An ML-powered scanner to detect malicious and phishing URLs.
* **Cloud Guard:** A configuration scanner to find vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure files.
* **AI Model Guard:** An anomaly detector to protect AI datasets from poisoning.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios
* **Backend API Gateway:** Node.js, Express.js
* **ML Microservices:** Python, Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* **Database:** MongoDB (for future alert logging)
